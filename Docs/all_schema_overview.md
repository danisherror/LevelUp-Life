Great question! Besides the **User** schema, here are the key schemas youâ€™ll want to include for your self-improvement leveling website to work smoothly and be scalable:

## Essential Schemas for Your Project

### 1. **Quest (Task) Schema**

* Defines the quests/tasks users create.
* Includes recurring info, points, descriptions, deadlines.

### 2. **Quest Completion Schema**

* Tracks each time a quest is completed.
* Essential for streaks, progress, and history.

### 3. **Friendship / Social Schema**

* To enable friends, comparisons, and leaderboards.
* Example fields: `user_id`, `friend_id`, `status` (pending, accepted, blocked).

### 4. **User Profile Schema**

* Additional user info separate from authentication:

  * Avatar
  * Bio
  * Preferences (notifications, privacy)
  * Level, total points earned (cached for quick access)

### 5. **Notification / Reminder Schema**

* To manage scheduled reminders or notifications:

  * User ID

  * Notification type (email, push)
  * Scheduled time
  * Status (sent, pending)
