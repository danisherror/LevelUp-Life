# ðŸ§  Implementation Tips

* **Start small & iterate:** Build core quest, completion, and reminders system first.
* **Use analytics early:** Track user engagement data to decide which social or gamification features users want.
* **Build social features gradually:** Start with friend leaderboards before adding groups and chats.
* **Keep UI simple:** Focus on clarity & motivation â€” gamify subtly to avoid overwhelming users.
* **Test reminders:** User-configured reminders can make or break daily engagement.
* **Gather feedback:** Use surveys or in-app feedback to guide feature improvements.
