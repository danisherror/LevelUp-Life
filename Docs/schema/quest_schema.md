Perfect‚Äîlet‚Äôs focus purely on the **schema design of the quest**, without implementation details or tech stack. Here's a clean and well-thought-out schema to capture the essence of a "quest" in your self-improvement gamified system:

## üß† Summary

A quest = **task + game mechanics + scheduling + rewards**
The goal of this schema is to let the quest behave like:

* A **single goal** (e.g., ‚ÄúWrite journal today‚Äù)
* Or a **habit tracker** (e.g., ‚ÄúMeditate every day‚Äù)
* Or a **goal with an end date** (e.g., ‚ÄúComplete course by next month‚Äù)

---

Would you like to move next to:

* **Schema for tracking completions/streaks?**
* Or **finalizing categories/fields for frequency logic** (e.g., custom repeat patterns)?

##  Quest Completion Table (logs each completion instance)
