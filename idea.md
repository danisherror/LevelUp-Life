i am thinking of crating a website, that is for self improvement.
It will have same system as leveling as in games.
You do a task you get the rewards.
At the end you can see how much points you have aquired or what work you have done in the past.
or you can compare your work with your friend to see who has done more work or leading a more self improvement life.

This website can act as your to-do as you can convert your work into a quest and assign some points to it.
or you can assign some task to yourself like drinking 3 lt water per day or doing basic streching everyday (these are repeative task).
Here the repeative task will give you points but they will refresh every day, but you will get the points.
Along with that this site can send you remainders in mail, stating that you have taken these task to complete it today,
but you have not completed them, like that etc

Here‚Äôs how you can take your concept and structure it into a full-fledged web platform, along with some suggestions for key features, technical stack, and a basic roadmap.
